        <p>My neighbor was back from HongKong! <br>
        I haven't seen him for 2 years and he looks just as annoying as 2 years ago (kidding, love him).<br>
        We went to movies and I met his pet in his house! It's actually his brother's cat coco but coco is addicted to him. Now coco has officially become his pet. Coco is a british shorthair, which is my favorate type of cat.<br>

        <p>I'm going to school!<br>
        It's going to be my first time leaving my families and my love country and study in a new country. I have never been to Canada and I think it's going to be great. Hopefully I do not regret my choice:)
